# kenpo-animations Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality
All code must adhere to the established style guide and be statically analyzed for correctness and style. All new code must be peer-reviewed.

### II. Testing Standards
Every feature must be accompanied by a comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests. Test-Driven Development (TDD) is strongly encouraged. All tests must pass before a change is merged.

### III. User Experience Consistency
All user-facing components must adhere to the project's design system and style guide to ensure a consistent and intuitive user experience.

### IV. Performance Requirements
New features must be benchmarked to ensure they meet performance targets. Regressions in performance must be addressed before release.

## Governance
