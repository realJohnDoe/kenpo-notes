title: Welcome to my Kenpo Notes
---

# Overview

These are my Kenpo notes, written in markdown with [Obsidian] and rendered to this website
using [Quartz].

[Obsidian]: https://obsidian.md/
[Quartz]: https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/

Here are the different sections of this page:

- [[content/2-belts/index|Belts]]
- [[content/3-forms/index|Forms]]
- [[content/4-sets/index|Sets]]

There are also the first two parts of the focus techniques in our Dojo:

- [[1-beginners-techniques|Beginner's Techniques]]
- [[2-intermediate-techniques|Intermediate Techniques]]

If you like this site, feel free to drop me a star on [GitHub] or even contribute some ideas for
improvement.

Main Kudos for introducing me to Kenpo go to my [Dojo in Esslingen] üôè.
