title: Welcome to my Kenpo Notes

# Overview

These are my kenpo notes, written in markdown and rendered to this website
using [Quartz].

Here are the different sections of this page:

- [[Belts]]
- [[Forms and Sets]]

There is also the first two parts of the focus techniques in our Dojo:

- [[Beginner's Techniques]]
- [[Intermediate Techniques]]

If you like this site, feel free to drop me a star on [GitHub] or even contribute some ideas for
improvement.

Main Kudos for introducing me to Kenpo go to my [Dojo in Esslingen].
